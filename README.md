### Things to do:
- An image segmentation algorithm to extract the models from the background: Mask RCNN (completed!)
 - Source: https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN
- A Pose machine algorithm to assign points to each joint: Human Pose Estimation using Tensorflow (completed!)
 - Source: https://github.com/eldar/pose-tensorflow
- An image warping algorithm to warp the model's joint points to the user's joint points: Radial Basis Function (in progress...)
 - Source: https://github.com/mathLab/PyGeM
- An algorithm to swap the head on the user onto the warped model's body: (not started)
